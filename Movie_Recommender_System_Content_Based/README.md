## 1.Movie Recommendations For You
![Movie Recommendations!](yt_thumb.JPG")

## 2.Source
- [IMDB Top_5000 Movies Data](https://github.com/balusena/balu-ds-streamlitapp/tree/main/Movie_Recommender_System_Content_Based/Data)

## 3.Features
- User Responsive UI
- Movie Story
- Movie Posters
- Directors & Cast information
- Total ratings*
- IMDB Ratings‚≠ê

## 4.Usage
- Clone my repository < https://github.com/balusena/balu-ds-streamlitapp/tree/main/Movie_Recommender_System_Content_Based >
- Open CMD in working directory.
- Run following command.
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- 'app.py' is the main Python file of Streamlit Web-Application. 
- To run app, write following command in CMD. or use any IDE.
- streamlit run App.py
- 'Movie_Data_Processing.ipynb' is the notebook of data processing.
- 'Classifier.py' is the main file which is containing a KNN Algorithm.
- For more explanation of this project see the tutorial on Machine Learning Hub YouTube channel.

## 6.Streamlit sharing.io cloud deployment
- The app is deployed on Streamlt Cloud at ===> 

## 7.Further work to be done
- 1.The current implementation would work well for movies not in the dataset. It will also work for movies already in the dataset, but the same movie would also appear among the recommendations. Need to fix this.
- 2.Need to implement the recommender using KNN instead of similarity index and compare results
- 3.Need to work using larger movie datasets such as the MovieLens dataset or the official IMDB dataset
- 4.Find a way to measure how similar the movies are with the current implementation (I would be grateful if someone could help me on this project enhancement.)
